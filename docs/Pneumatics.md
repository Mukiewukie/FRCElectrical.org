# Pneumatics

The Pneumatic System works to deliver quick, typically linear, movements using compressed air. While not used in Modern FRC, they are important to learn properly!

They can be **very** dangerous: [IRI 2022 Incident](https://clips.twitch.tv/QuaintAcceptableWormDancingBaby-qqE-DulX9UcVpgSX?tt_content=url&tt_medium=clips_api)

This is the general FRC Pneumatics Layout you need to learn:

Here are the FRC Pneumatic Components Explained:
* Compressor: Charges air for components on the robot, like a battery that provides electricity to components, and the compressor provides air.

* Pressure Switch: Works with a controller to tell the compressor when to shut off.

* Solenoid Valves: Electronically controlled valves.

* Pneumatic Controllers
  * PH/PCM: Controls the compressor and up to 8 solenoids. It gains input for a pressure sensor to control the compressor when needed. CAN-based communication
  * Pressure Switch: Manages amount of pressure in the robot. Acts as “go-between” for the PCM and compressor.
  * Dump Valve: Releases (or dumps) all air out of the robot.

* Electrical Solenoid Valve(s): Actuates the different sides of a pneumatic component, such as a shifter or piston. Can be single or double action.

* Compressor: Charges air for components such as pistons and shifters on the robot. FRC-legal amount of air is 120 psi (pounds per square inch). 

* Emergency Relief Valve: Keeps the air under 125 psi if the compressor or pressure switch is working incorrectly

Be sure to stay safe and use Pneumatics properly!
